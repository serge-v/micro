.SH NAME
micro \- A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B micro
.RB [OPTIONS]
[FILE]\&...

.SH DESCRIPTION

Micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities
of modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies.

As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be
enjoyable to use full time, whether you work in the terminal because you prefer it (like me), or because you need to (over ssh).

.SH CONFIGURATION

Micro uses
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/micro\fR
for configuration by default. If it is not set, micro uses ~/.config/micro.
Two main configuration files are settings.json, containing the user's
settings, and bindings.json, containing the user's custom keybindings.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Micro's behaviour can be changed by setting environment variables, of which there is currently only one:
\fIMICRO_TRUECOLOR\fR.
When MICRO_TRUECOLOR is set to 1, micro will attempt to treat your terminal as a true-color terminal and will be able to make full use of the true-color colorschemes that are included with micro. If MICRO_TRUECOLOR is not set or is set to 0, then micro will only make use of 256 color features and will internally map true-color colorschemes to the nearest colors available. For more information see micro's documentation.

.SH NOTICE
This manpage is intended only to serve as a quick guide to the invocation of 
micro and is not intended to replace the full documentation included with micro
which can be accessed from within micro. Micro tells you what key combination to
press to get help in the lower right.

.SH BUGS
A comprehensive list of bugs will not be listed in this manpage. See the Github
page at \fBhttps://github.com/zyedidia/micro/issues\fP for a list of known bugs
and to report any newly encountered bugs you may find. We strive to correct
bugs as swiftly as possible.
